        Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.Computer science spans theoretical
        disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines
        (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).

        Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science. The theory of computation concerns abstract
        models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography
        and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security
        vulnerabilities.
        Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images.
        Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes,
        and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates
        the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and
        principles
        behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the
        principles and
        design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and
        computer-operated
        equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as
        problem-solving,
        decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial
        intelligence,
        computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to
        understand and
        process textual and linguistic data.

        video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.

        The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated. The
        Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.




        Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) developed logic in a binary number system and has been called the "founder
        of computer science".

        Charles Babbage is sometimes referred to as the "father of computing".

        Ada Lovelace published the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer.
        The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital
        computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding
        in computations such as multiplication and division. Algorithms for performing computations have existed since
        antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.

        Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623. In 1673,
        Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner.[18] Leibniz may be
        considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact
        that he documented the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator
        industry[note 1] when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and
        reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage started the design of the first
        automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first
        programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine. He started developing this machine in 1834, and
        "in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer". "A
        crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom" making it infinitely
        programmable. In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace
        wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered
        to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer. Around
        1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information;
        eventually his company became part of IBM. Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy
        Ludgate in 1909 published] the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. In
        1914, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo published his Essays on Automatics,] and designed,
        inspired by Babbage, a theoretical electromechanical calculating machine which was to be controlled by a
        read-only program. The paper also introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic. In 1920, to
        celebrate the 100th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer, Torres presented in Paris the
        Electromechanical Arithmometer, a prototype that demonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical
        engine, on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically. In 1937, one hundred
        years after Babbage's impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card
        equipment and was also in the calculator business[28] to develop his giant programmable calculator, the
        ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit.
        When the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".
